=== Solving problems with missing DLL files ===

Certain versions of Windows ship without DLL files needed to programmatically launch a JVM. You will need to make the files IEShims.dll and MSVCR71.DLL available to windows.

IEShims.dll is normally included with Internet Explorer installs. To make windows find this file globally, you need to add the IE install folder to your PATH.

. Right click on "My Computer" or "Computer"
. Select "Properties"
. Click on "Advanced" or "Advanced system settings"
. Click the "Environment variables" button
. Find the path varible, and add C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer to it (or the install location of IE, if you have installed it somewhere else).

MSVCR71.DLL needs to be downloaded. There does not seem to be a download available for it directly from Microsoft, and the Microsoft support site points to a download at http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71

Download the dll, and put it in c:\Windows\System32\


If you are still getting errors about missing DLL files, you can use http://www.dependencywalker.com/ to open your jvm.dll (located in JAVA_HOME/bin/client/ or JAVA_HOME/bin/server/), and it will tell you if there are other missing dlls.
